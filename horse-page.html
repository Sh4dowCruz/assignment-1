    <p class="paragraph">
        The horse is a domesticated animal that has been used by humans for thousands of years.<br>
        Horses are known for their speed, strength, and beauty.
        These horses can be used for riding and racing.<br>
        Horses are herbivores, which means they eat plants.<br>
        They have a keen sense of smell and hearing, and they are known for their loyalty to humans.
